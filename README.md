# psychopy experiments

Each folder hosts the code for a cognitive psychology experiment I've worked on in the past. All the experiments are coded in Python and are meant to be executed with the PsychoPy package.

RMS (Relational match to sample): I actually coded this up for a fellow graduate student who was just starting in the lab. This experiment investigates people's preference for visual similarities over abstract relational similarities when forced to choose between the two. For further reading, see Kotvsky and Gentner (1996)

exceptions: It's known in the category learning literature that similarity among items increases as you learn they belong to the same category. The point of this experiment was to study if and how learning with an exception (think whales relative to mammals) disrupts this process. For further reading, see Silliman, Snoddy, Wetzel, and Kurtz (2020)

SELF (surprise enhances learning of features): A core principle in the reinforcement learning literature is that surprise (i.e., incorrect predictions) can strengthen associations between cues and outcomes. I was interested in investigating whether this learning signal also generalized to incidental associations present in the learning context. For tangentially related reading, see Seitz & Watanabe (2003; "Is subliminal learning really passive?").

Covecat (covert categorization): For this experiment, I was curious as to whether learners could update their category representations without seeing new examples of the category. I imagined that strongly related changes to neighboring categories could have an effect on the relevant category 'covertly'. This one was somewhat out of the blue so I don't really have much recommended reading for it.
